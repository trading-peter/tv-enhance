# TV Enhance
Chrome Extension to make working with TradingView charts a little bit more intuitive.

## What can it do
So far you're able to set custom keyboard shortcuts for drawing tools and some chart settings.

## How to develop
First install dependencies with `npm install`.

Install gowebbuild (`go install github.com/trading-peter/gowebbuild@latest`)
You need to have a working Go installation for this.

Run `gowebbuild` in the project root to build the extension.

Load the project as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
